=  Description  =
This is a simple tcp chat server called 'tcs'.
User connects to tcs via tcp port 127.0.0.1:6667
After tcp is established, user should login with "#\name $USER" for example, 
"$\name: Bob\n" within 10s otherwise tcp connection will be closed by server
 for security consideration.

After login, user can start to send chat messages and it will be boardcast to 
the other users on the same server.
